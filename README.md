# m2clust: multi-resolution clustering of omics data #

**m2clust** is a clustering method that detects
clusters of features using omics data and scores metadata 
(resolution score) based on their influences in clustering.
The similarity of features within each cluster can be 
different (different resolution). Resolution of similarity score takes to 
account not only similarity between measurements and 
also the structure in a hierarchical structure of data and 
number of features which group together.
